This repository contains the complete results of simulation experiments described in the third chapter of Renan Serenini's PhD thesis. The experiment compares two specification strategis in spatial econometrics: Specific to General (STGE) and General to Specific (GETS).
Heatmaps are inside the respective folders and a collection of .gif files is available in the folder [ANIMATIONS](https://github.com/serenini/specification_search/tree/main/ANIMATIONS) for better visualization.
